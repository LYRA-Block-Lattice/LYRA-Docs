# Why Lyra is Already a DeFi Solution

*Slava Gomzin, Co-founder and developer of Lyra - loyalty rewards on blockchain*

I received several questions during recent AMA (“ask me anything”) sessions around [DeFi](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2020/08/14/defi-welcome-to-the-crypto-revolution) (“decentralized finance”), 
such as *“Is Lyra a DeFi project?”* or *“How is Lyra related to DeFi?”*
So I decided to clarify this topic as the DeFi movement became very popular and keeps getting even more traction.

To make things clear at the beginning and the long story short, **Lyra blockchain is a DeFi technology** in its core, 
because it was designed, architected, and coded as a DeFi blockchain, 
and it was DeFi-driven even when it only existed on paper ([the white paper](https://github.com/LYRA-Block-Lattice/LYRA-Docs/blob/master/LYRA-BLock-Lattice-White-Paper.md) to be more precise). 
The only missing thing was the word “DeFi” itself because it was not so hot back in January 2019 when Lyra white paper was first published.
So let’s see how Lyra follows the DeFi pattern, without the need to edit the white paper,
adjust the development roadmap, or even change the architecture and source code.

First of all, Lyra is designed as a multi-token blockchain, where each token represents a unique digital asset.
In the [LoyalShopper app](https://lyra.live/#loyalshopper), tokens represent reward points, discount codes, and other assets - depending on use case. 
Each merchant - LoyalShopper customer - receives a pair (at least) of its own branded tokens, 
which are freely tradeable on decentralized reward token marketplace. 
All these features are elements of a so-called *closed loop payment system* implemented on decentralized, permissionless blockchain. 
**LoyalShopper is a DeFi application** which is [already implemented](https://loyalshopper-dev-store-local.myshopify.com/)
and waiting to be launched in [production](https://t.me/LYRA_Announcements/22) very soon.

But if we go deeper into the history of Lyra, before even the idea of LoyalShopper solution came up,
we can see that among the first lines of the original Lyra white paper there are following objectives:
* Create a payment platform that provides “out of the box” basic features of modern payment processing networks such as privacy, real time authorizations, buyer-friendly fee structure, multi-currency support, special merchant transaction flows, and custom merchant tokens
* Provide virtually unlimited scalability to enable TPS (transactions per second) rates competitive with existing “traditional” payment processing networks
* Eliminate a prolonged locking of funds in user wallets (both payer and payee) caused by waiting for multiple “block confirmations”
* Reduce the network latency that affects transaction authorization times to the levels acceptable by the payment industry
* Provide built-in open banking features that would provide financial benefits to all stakeholders
* Decouple the payment platform from any specific cryptocurrency

Next to the objectives, there is a base use case section, with the following use cases among others:
* Make an instant, zero-fee payment to online or brick-and-mortar merchant
* Instantly send crypto or fiat currency to any person using email address
* Instantly exchange crypto or fiat currencies to other digital assets

Those objectives and use cases show that **Lyra is a pure DeFi solution**. 
Fortunately, the objectives are already achieved, implemented in the Lyra blockchain, and available “out of the box” to Lyra developers and users.
The use cases, however, require additional development of a *decentralized liquidity pool* - 
I guess another term that became popular in conjunction with DeFi. 
Since creation of such a decentralized liquidity pool is not a trivial task, 
we postponed its implementation to [phase 2 of Lyra project](https://docs.lyra.live/lyra-network-1/practical-applications). 
However, we have defined a path forward already on design and implementation - 
it is going to be done as a [**Multisig Deposit Vault for Decentralized Digital Asset Tokenization**](https://github.com/LYRA-Block-Lattice/LYRA-Docs/blob/master/Multisig%20Deposit%20Vault%20for%20Decentralized%20Digital%20Asset%20Tokenization.md). 
Once implemented, the Multisig Deposit Vault will unlock a Pandora box of additional DeFi use cases defined in the original white paper. 
We just need more time and support from people who want to participate in the DeFi revolution.
